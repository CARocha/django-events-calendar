Thanks for downloading django-events-calendar

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you have the python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can 
also type the following to download and install in one step::

    easy_install -Z django-events-calendar

(the ``-Z`` flag is required to force ``easy_install`` to do a normal
source install rather than a zipped egg)

Or if you are using ``pip``::

    pip install django-events-calendar

Or if you'd prefer you can simple place the included ``events``
directory somewhere on your python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you are working from a 
Git checkout.

Note that this application requires python 2.3 or later, and a 
functional installation of Django 1.3.x or newer.  You can obtain python
from http://www.python.org and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
